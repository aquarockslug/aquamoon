# AQUAMOON CONFIGURATION

- I like using Lua as a configuration language and I try to use it as much as possible

- I use the river window manager with river-luatile so that I can use lua to configure the window manager and window layout.

- I always access the terminal from inside neovide so that I don't have to configure a separate terminal program. 

- Tofi is launched by a Lua script. The script can set parameters based on data from other Lua files so Tofi doesn't need its own configuration file.

- So far the only parts that are not configured with Lua is Sandbar and parts of Zsh.
